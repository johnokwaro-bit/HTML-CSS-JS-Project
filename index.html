            <p>Increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere is the reason the world is experiencing climate change. Therefore, to win the war against climate change we have to identify was to reduce the GHG emissions. Of the several GHGs, Carbon (IV) oxide is the most important. This id due to its vast sources, its high concentration in the atmosphere and the fact that it stays longer in the atmosphere. Carbon (IV) oxide is majorly emitted from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial combustion. The other GHG of importance is the Methane gas. Unlike Carbon (IV) oxide, it stays in the atmosphere for about 12 years. It is, however, considered the most important because its emission into the atmosphere is increasing with time. Further, Methane has about 28 to 36 times higher global warming potential as compared to Carbon (IV) oxide </p>

        <h3>Did COVID-19 have effect on GHGs emissions, especially Carbon (IV) Oxide?</h3>        
    </div>
        <div>
            <p>Several studies have tried to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on CO2   emissions across the globe. Liu et al. (2020) noted that the pandemic affected the energy sector and industrial production the most. Reports from some countries show that the decline in the two sectors was about 30% in a few weeks. Larsen et al. (2020), on the other hand, estimated that COVID-19 containment measures caused changes in energy markets, industrial production, transportation behaviour, building use, and agricultural production, which lowered GHG emissions in the United States by about 18% from mid-March to mid-June 2020 in comparison to the same period in 2019. They also noted that the oil and gas sector was affected the most since the economic decline resulted in a collapse in oil prices and led to cuts in oil and gas production.</p>
            <p>Another study by Kumar et al. (2021) outlined the changes in GHG emissions. The study involved a review of published literature, information from various organizations, and case studies that looked into how COVID-19 influenced changes in energy consumption. The report revealed that by 1st November 2020, emissions dropped globally by 7.1%. This was attributed to the containment policies that resulted in reduced energy consumption. The report further revealed that by 2025, all countries across the globe would have experienced a drop in GHG emission.</p>
            <p>Further, the report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020) showed that the energy demand dropped by about 4% in the year 2020 while globally, energy-related CO2 emissions declined by about 5.8%. This is considered the largest annual decline in emissions since World War II. Just like Larsen et al. (2020), the IEA (2020) report noted that the demand for fossil fuels was hardest hit in the year 2020. The report estimates that oil and coal demand dropped by 8.6% and 4% respectively. In addition to that, the report found out that the decline in oil demand was at its largest ever and that it accounted for more than half of the global emissions drop. To put this into perspective, the report estimated the decline in emissions from the oil used to be over 1 100 MtCO2e in the year 2020, down from about 11 400 MtCO2e in the year 2019 (IEA, 2020).</p>
            <p>From the various studies cited in this research, it is clear that the COVID-19 containment policies that were put in place by governments across the globe led to a measurable decline in CO2 emissions. However, it is not clear how much the COVID-19 pandemic will affect emissions in the future (Nguyen et al., 2021).</p>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>        
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>It is clear from the research that have been carried out so far that climate change is a disaster in waiting and effort need to be made to ensure that GHGs emissions are cut and the concentration in the atmosphere are reduced. Some of the measures that can be put in place to achieve this are as discussed below.</p>        
    </div>
        <div>
           <ul>
              <li>Since economic recovery is causing a rise in CO2 emissions, it means that more emissions are expected as we move into the future. This may see a rise in CO2 concentration above the projected values. Therefore, policymakers need to move with speed to mitigate the rising CO2 concentration. Further, reducing GHG emissions is a collective responsibility. Governments therefore need to partner with universities, the private sector, and the civil society to educate the citizens on the importance of reducing emissions and ways of doing so.</li>
              <li>To achieve long-term CO2 emissions mitigation, Governments should subsidise renewable energy cost; promote the uptake of electric vehicles; invest in non-motorised transport and mass transit solutions to reduce the use of personal cars; promote green building in Kenya through policy development and revision of the building code; and promote tree planting to increase forest cover beyond the recommended 10%. Further, energy-intensive industries should invest in solar PV systems to boost clean energy at the expense of diesel generators.</li>
